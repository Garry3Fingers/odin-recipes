      <h2 class="curry-header">How to Make Chicken Carry</h2>
      <p>
        Start by partially cooking your seasoned chicken breasts in a large pan, removing them after they're browned. After
        setting the chicken breasts aside, cook garlic, onions, and ginger in the same pan to create the flavor base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the onions are translucent, add in spices, tomatoes, yogurt, and chicken to cook thoroughly. Cover and simmer for
        about 20 minutes for a wow-worthy chicken curry. Finish with fresh herbs and a squeeze of lemon.
