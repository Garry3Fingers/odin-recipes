# odin-recipes
I'll create my first website using basic HTML elements like &lt;p&gt;, &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;strong&gt; and etc.
This site will contain homepage and few extra pages with recipes.
I'll use anchor elements to link my pages and &lt;img&gt; elements to display my images.
Also it'll be the first train with git commit messages
